# prism-electron

> [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) JavaScript highlighter optimized for Electron/Node.js

### But why use this instead of the original [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism)

- Prism is 2.1MB and prism-electron is 230KB(the module includes only the core logic and all associated languages, no examples, tests, themes, plugins)
- lazy loading of languages increases start up time by a LOT
